# About
This project aims to import the inMoov chatbot personality "Henry"
from its MyrobotLab-Environment to a new ROS-Environment
using the chatbot engine "Program-Y".

## Roadmap:
### High Priority
* make Henry-aiml files functional under Program-Y
* connect chatbot to ROS-node using existing "Program-Y"-clients and ROSbridge.
  Most likely socket-client for now
### Normal Priority
* make into ROS-Package
### Low Priority
* create a dedicated ROS-client in Program-Y which publishes Messages
