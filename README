This project aims to import the inMoov chatbot personality "Henry"
from MyrobotLab to ROS using the chatbot engine "Program-Y" from
https://github.com/keiffster/program-y


Roadmap:
    * make Henry-aiml files functional under Program-Y
    * connect chatbot to ROS-node using existing "Program-Y"-clients and ROSbridge.
        Most likely socket-client for now
    + create as ROS-Package
    - create a dedicated ROS-client in Program-Y which publishes Messages
